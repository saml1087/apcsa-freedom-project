# APCSA Freedom Project
by Sam Lee

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for APCSA is all about innovating an idea with the independent study of a tool in order to create a working prototype throughout the school year. For APCSA students, we had a lot of freedom in what tool we could pick, including both java and non-java tools. The purpose of this blog is to document each step of the process in creating this game including both snip-its of the code and the product itself.

## Content
For my project, I am making a 3D Physics-related game in which the goal of the game is to enter rightward and upward forces to get the ball into the bucket. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Unity in order to make this physics game functional, playable, and enjoyable.

## Implications
My game is solely created for entertainment. Although it doesn't necessarily have a direct global, social, or economic effects, the game does achieve to make some impact. This means having a 3D environment that could potentially be used as a simulation. However, at the current stage of the game, there's no correlation betweeen real world physics and in-game physics. It has the biggest social impact as it may bring joy to individuals and create a fun environment for the community. As mentioned earlier, although it doesn't necessarily have a direct global or economic effect, the game serves as a source of entertainment for players to interact with.
