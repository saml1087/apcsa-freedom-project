I've finalized my tool, **Unity**, which is what I'm going to use to help build my **Paperball Physics Game**. *[Unity](https://unity.com/)* is a 3D game engine, that uses C# as its primary coding language. I've also been interested in other game development softwares such as *[Phaser](https://phaser.io/)*, another popular tool for game design. However, that software is 2-Dimensional. I've finalized Unity as my main tool because of its 3D capabilities, which is more suitable to what I'm building. 

Getting a little into what I want my project to be, the game that I'm building involves an object, such as a paper ball, to be thrown into another object, such as a bin. It's going to involve some knowledge of physics as the user is meant to calculate the force necessary to push the paper ball in its desired location. That's the basic level, _or the viable part of the project_, that I want it to be. Because this involves a bit of physics, I felt like the 3D aspect of Unity perfectly aligns with what I could make with the project. It's a little challenging as I'll have to learn C# but the end result will definitely be satisfying.


At this point of _the Engineering Design Process_, I am *Researching the Problem*. As I'm making a game, there's not really a "problem," but I would consider my current stage as researching ways to help with the building of my game. With my next steps, I hope to be able to brainstorm ways that I could break my project into milestones and start planning out the things I'm going to create for my Freedom Project.

Through this researching process, I've been obtaining useful skills that isn't just applicable to the freedom project. For example, I've learned to be mindful of *logical reasoning*. It isn't logical for me to build something extremely big. If I said I were to build multiple levels and a whole bunch of different functionalities in my game, I would be unrealistic. Instead, I had to think of what I __CAN__ make, and not what I *think* I can make. Another skill I've learned is *consideration*. In addition to what I've said earlier, it's bad to have something too big but also too small. I had to consider factors in my game that would be somewhat enjoyable and have a clear goal in mind. It should entertain the player and have an objective that makes the game fun. With the both of these skills combined, there's a *goldilock condition* that I should keep in mind about the game.
